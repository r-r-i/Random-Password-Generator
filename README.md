# JavaScript : Password Generator

## Task

For this challenge, I was given the task of modifying starter code that would create an application that generates a random password based on the user's selected criteria. This application runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code I wrote. The application displays a clean and polished response UI that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
